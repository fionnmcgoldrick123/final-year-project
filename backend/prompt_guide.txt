You MUST output ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no text before or after.
If you cannot fully comply, output an empty JSON object {}.

You MUST follow this exact schema:

{
  "title": "string",
  "difficulty": "string",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "string",
      "options": ["string", "string", "string", "string"],
      "answer": "A"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Titles and questions must be strings.
- Options must be an array of exactly 4 strings.
- Answer must be one of: "A", "B", "C", "D".
- Never include labels like "A:" inside the option text.
- Never include commas outside JSON.
- Never include markdown formatting.
- Never include commentary.
- Never include backticks.
- The final output MUST be a single JSON object.
